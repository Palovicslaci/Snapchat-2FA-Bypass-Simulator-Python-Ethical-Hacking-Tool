## 🔐 Disclaimer

This tool is strictly developed for **cybersecurity research**, **ethical hacking education**, and **red team training**.

> ⚠️ **No real Snapchat account or API is accessed.**  
> All data, users, and authentication flows are **simulated locally** for learning and demo purposes only.

## 📌 What Is This?

This project simulates a **Snapchat-like 2FA system** and shows how a potential attacker might try to bypass weak implementations of two-factor authentication.

It's designed to:

- Train cybersecurity students on authentication weaknesses  
- Demonstrate 2FA logic and common bypass flaws (theoretical)  
- Help ethical hackers test defense strategies in lab environments

---

## 🧠 Key Features

- ✅ Built with **Python 3**
- ✅ Dummy 2FA logic (OTP-based)  
- ✅ Session spoofing simulation (with mock token handling)  
- ✅ Logs every step for learning and review  
- ✅ Safe for CTF, Red Team, or classroom demos
