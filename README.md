## üîê Disclaimer

This tool is strictly developed for **cybersecurity research**, **ethical hacking education**, and **red team training**.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **No real Snapchat account or API is accessed.**  
> All data, users, and authentication flows are **simulated locally** for learning and demo purposes only.

## üìå What Is This?

This project simulates a **Snapchat-like 2FA system**. It demonstrates how a potential attacker might try to bypass weak implementations of two-factor authentication.

It's designed to:

- Train cybersecurity students on authentication weaknesses  
- Demonstrate 2FA logic and common bypass flaws (theoretical)  
- Help ethical hackers test defenses
